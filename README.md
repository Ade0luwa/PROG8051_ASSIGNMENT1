Name of Application: Adeoluwatomiwa's Virtual Pet Simulator

Programming Language used: C#

This application simulates the caring of a pet. The application has provided 3 main attributes for the pet; hunger, Happiness, and health. Also, there are 3 activities that you can perform with your pet; Feed, Rest, and Play. All you need to do is regularly interact with the pet to keep it well-fed, happy, and healthy.
 
There are consequences for every action and no action. Playing with your pet increases the pet's happiness and hunger. Feeding your pet takes care of the hunger and increases health; resting your pet increases health but reduces happiness. Leaving your pet idle for an hour increases hunger and decreases happiness.

Application Features
1) A user can select a pet type and give it a name
2) A user can feed, play, or put the pet to rest. All of these actions have consequences
3) A user can track and know the status of the pet and any point in time
4) Neglecting your pet will also reflect in its status.
